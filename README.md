ðŸ“Š Data Profiling Layer â€” Healthcare Project
Overview
This Profiling Layer provides automated Data Quality Monitoring for the HEALTHCARE.RAW tables.

âœ… It was fully generated from the official CMS Healthcare Data Dictionary + CSV headers.
âœ… All models use safe aliasing and no trailing commas â†’ 100% dbt and Snowflake compliant.
âœ… The models are fully incremental and optimized.

Architecture
Each table in HEALTHCARE.RAW has a corresponding profiling model:

models/monitoring/profile_<table_name>_tracking.sql

Each profiling model performs:

Row count check

Null count check per column

Standardized output:

table_name

run_date

row_count

<column>_null_count for every column in the table

How to run
bash
Copy
Edit
dbt run --select path:models/monitoring
All profiling models will run in parallel.

You can schedule this as a dbt Cloud Job â†’ to monitor your data daily / weekly.

Why this matters
Automated Data Quality Monitoring is critical in a modern Data Platform.

By running this layer:

You detect missing values trends over time.

You track record volume anomalies.

You can alert on schema changes.

You maintain transparency with data consumers.

Future Improvements
âœ… Add deduplication checks
âœ… Add outlier checks
âœ… Add distribution profiling (e.g. top values, min/max per column)
âœ… Load results to a central tracking table â†’ for dashboards in Looker, Power BI, Streamlit.

Credits
This profiling layer was generated automatically from:

âœ… CMS Healthcare Data Dictionary
âœ… CSV file headers from official CMS data sources
âœ… Automated with Python + dbt macro templates.
